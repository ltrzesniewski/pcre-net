  <param>
    <param name="subject">The subject string to be matched.</param>
  </param>

  <param>
    <param name="pattern">The regular expression pattern.</param>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        Note that using a static matching method is not efficient. For best performance,
        create a <see cref="PcreRegex"/> object and use its instance methods.
      </para>
    </remarks>
  </param>

  <param>
    <param name="startIndex">The index at which the match should be attempted.</param>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        Passing a non-zero
        <paramref name="startIndex"/>
        differs from passing a shortened string if the pattern
        starts with an assertion (such as <c>\b</c>) or contains lookbehinds.
      </para>
    </remarks>
  </param>

  <param>
    <param name="options">Additional options to apply for the match.</param>
  </param>

  <param>
    <param name="onCallout">A function to be called when a callout point is reached during the match.</param>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        Within a regular expression, <c>(?C&lt;arg&gt;)</c> indicates a point at which the external function is to be called.
        Different callout points can be identified by putting a number less than 256 after the letter C. The default value is zero.
        Alternatively, the argument may be a delimited string. The starting delimiter must be one of
        <c>` ' " ^ % # $ {</c>
        and the ending delimiter is the same as the start, except for <c>{</c>, where the ending delimiter is <c>}</c>.
        If the <see cref="PcreOptions.AutoCallout"/> option bit is set when a pattern is compiled, PCRE2 automatically inserts callouts,
        all with number 255, before each item in the pattern except for immediately before or after an explicit callout.
